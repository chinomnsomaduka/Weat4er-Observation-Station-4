where **LAT_N** is the northern latitude and **LONG_W** is the western longitude.
For example, if there are three records in the table with **CITY** values 'New York', 'New York', 'Bengalaru', there are 2 different city names: 'New York' and 'Bengalaru'. The query **1** returns , because **total number of records - number of unique city names = 3 -2 = 1** .
